# Pic Some

This is a simple e-commerce site built with React.  From the main page, users can favorite items and add them to the cart.  Once ready to checkout, users can go to the checkout page and click the 'Place Order' button to checkout.

This project is the capstone project from Scrimba's [Advanced React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/react).  This project touched on the use of React context, custom hooks, and the React Router.
